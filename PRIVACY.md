Vista Mobile - Privacy Policy V1

LAST UPDATED: June 6, 2023

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Vista Wallet, the official Syscoin & Rollux wallet, powered by the talented minds at Pollum. Vista is a reliable, open-source, multichain & evolving app focused on ensuring seamless interactions with blockchains and decentralized applications (dapps) across all EVM-compatible chains.

We believe in the open ethos of the blockchain world and we make an immense effort to minimize, and wherever feasible, eliminate the exposure of personal data during the use of our products.

Vista Wallet does not collect, hold, or store keys, account information, or passwords. We do not capitalize on the collection of data and do not use your data for marketing or advertising.

This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how Vista Wallet handles and protects personal information of people who use our mobile application ("App") or otherwise use our services (collectively, the “Services”).

This Policy applies to anyone who accesses the Services. Please read the Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. By using the Apps and/or the Services, you acknowledge that the collection, use, and sharing of your information will take place as described in this Policy.

So that we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information about an individual that (either by itself or when combined with information from other available sources) allows that individual to be identified, including but not limited to, the individual’s name, telephone number, or e-mail address.

THE BLOCKCHAIN

Considering the inherent transparency of many blockchains, including Syscoin & Rollux, transactions that users broadcast via Vista Wallet may be publicly accessible. This could include, but is not limited to, your public sending address, the receiver's public address, the transaction amount, and any other data a user chooses to include in a given transaction. The information stored on a blockchain might be public, unchangeable, and challenging or even impossible to remove. Transactions and addresses may inadvertently disclose information about the user's identity and such information could potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. Users are encouraged to understand how privacy and transparency on the blockchain work.


WHAT WE COLLECT

We may collect Personal Information you choose to provide to us. For example, when you contact us for support through the Services, you give us your e-mail address and any other information that you choose to provide. Also, if you participate in a Vista Wallet offer, give-away, or promotion (“Promotion”), you provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and any other required information.

USE OF INFORMATION

The information we collect about you is aimed to enhance your experience with our Services.

We may collect Personal Information you willingly provide to us. For instance, when you contact us for assistance through our Services, you provide us your email address and any other information you decide to share.

Also, in certain instances such as participating in a Vista offer, event or promotion ("Promotion"), you may provide your name, email address, postal address, and any other information necessary.

Furthermore, we might also collect information about visits to our App, or our Site/Blog, and use an analytics platform to track user activity. Although this platform may identify your IP address to recognize unique visitors, we do not collect or retain that information. We may, however, collect information about your operating system, visit duration, actions and views per visit, and referring site information.

HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION

The information we collect is used to provide, maintain, and enhance our Services for you.

We may use the Personal Information we gather to present our products and Services to you; provide you with requested information or services; respond to your comments, inquiries, and offer customer service; monitor and analyze usage and trends and enhance the Services and your experience using them; send email newsletters and marketing emails, which you can opt-out of; and for any other purpose with your consent.

We may use your information to reach out to you regarding our products and services that you request and/or that may interest you. Our email newsletters and marketing emails include directions on how to opt-out or unsubscribe. If you opt-out of marketing emails, we may still send you non-marketing emails and notifications, such as responses to your support or customer service requests.

SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

We respect your privacy and strive to protect your Personal Information. We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties, and we only share your Personal Information under limited circumstances.

We might share your Personal Information with service providers who help us to operate, enhance, and deliver our Services. These providers have access to your information as required to perform their functions but are strictly prohibited from using it for other purposes.

If we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information might be among the assets transferred. In such an event, we will notify you and assure that the acquirer will adhere to the commitments of this Policy.

Also, we might disclose your Personal Information as necessary to comply with any law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the rights and property of Vista Wallet, our agents, customers, and others, including enforcing our agreements, policies, and Terms of Service; and in an emergency, to protect the personal safety of Vista Wallet, our customers, or any person.

DATA SECURITY

We take the security of your Personal Information seriously and employ industry-standard physical, administrative, and technological safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through our Services.

We limit access to your Personal Information to those employees and contractors who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel. Despite our efforts, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.

LINKS TO OTHER SITES

The Services contain links to other third-party websites or applications. Once you click on such a link and leave the Site or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Policy. Any information you provide on those sites is subject to that third party’s privacy policy and we are not responsible for the privacy and security practices and policies of those third-party sites or applications.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

The App and the Services are controlled and operated by us from the United Arab Emirates and are not intended to subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the jurisdiction our Company is based on. Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the App or the Services you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United Arab Emirates, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.

CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Vista Wallet Services are not intended for or directed at individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information to us.

RETENTION

If you subscribe to our mailing list, we will retain the information you provide as long as you remain subscribed.

For other information you provide, we will retain such information in order to process your request, provide support, and/or carry out and fulfill our Promotions. If you request support, we will retain your information for no longer than six (6) months. If you participate in a Promotion, we will retain your information until the Promotion is carried out and ninety (90) days after any prize, reward, or offer is fulfilled. Your Personal Information will then be deleted.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may update our Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to our Policy, we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us or by placing a prominent notice on our App.
